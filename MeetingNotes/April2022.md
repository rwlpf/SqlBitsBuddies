 **Marketing of sql buddies communication to attendees**
 
Noted that since late in getting started that little marketing took place. The reason for that lack of time.  
It was suggested that when users sign up to register for the ticket on the website, there could be some form of marketing at this stage.  
Annabel will be creating a blog post to publicize what SQL Buddies are doing. The purpose of the page was to talk about the experience of being a SQL Buddy this year.  
The video interviews are being used. It was suggested we suggest using them from about three months before SQL Bits starts.

**Mission statement**

The purpose of the mission statement is primarily to clarify what we are about. Additionally, if you choose to do anything else, ask if it matches the mission statement. The following was suggested as an example.  
I am making SQL Bits a friendly, welcoming experience for anyone.  
Following a short discussion, it was noted that this required more work.

**What do we repeat from this year?**
 
Ensure that at least one or two always people are in the community zone.  
The question arose from that does this need to add to the timetable. In the same way that monitoring a room is also done. I would also need to consider if someone also has to go to a session at the same time. For example, they are in the community zone and require to be room monitoring.We noted that Annette was very good at finding people at the event by themselves. She was able to direct people to the buddies.The suggestion was made that could the SQL buddies be announced at morning briefings for the volunteers so people are aware of them and what they intend to do.It would be good to have buddies at the community zone for registration. Although as noted, there were some challenges this year. That meant buddies were required elsewhere.Flexibility to respond to the different requirements was appreciated.

**What do not we repeat from this year?**
  
The whiteboard for people to sign up for dinner did not work. There are several possible reasons for this since the venue changes each year. This is different from an event like PASS Summit, where this has been done before. The venue does not change from year to year. Since SQL Bits will change venue from year to year, it is impossible to know what food options are available. Suggested that similar to SQL run could organize a group make it known and see what happensQuiz sign up for a team did not work as hoped. So they are suggested to have a team with spaces for people to join if some buddies were at the community corner before the quiz could direct people to the teams with spaces.Meet the speaker did not work as expected since there was no dedicated area in the venue. The general impression was the speakers talked to those people that they knew. Also, some people who did attend did feel overwhelmed when meeting a speaker. The suggestion was to hold this at the venue, particularly if the speaker has some prep which has to be done for the Pre Conference.

**Change the regular meeting time and date.**
  
There was a discussion regarding changing the time of the meeting. However, given some participants' time zones, there was no time which would make it easier for everyone. Hence the meeting will remain as per the current arrangement.

**Slack channel**
  
The slack channel was set up for volunteers during the run-up to SQL bits and the event. Each year after the event, access to the slack channel is removed for the previous year's volunteers. So Steph Martin has proposed to use a Discourse channel, which she has set up and shared its details. One feature noted is the voice/video channels to allow ad-hoc conversations without setting up a meeting application such as teams
