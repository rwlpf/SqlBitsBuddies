Purpose - to provide some suggestions and assistance for someone creating a business case for attending the SQL Bits conference.

Reasons for send your team member(s) to a conference.

If the member is putting forward a request to attend a conference, they will be the person who -:

 - Proactive seeking out solutions
 -   Is keen to learn
 -   Apply what they learn to increase business productivity
 -   Willing to act on own initiative
 -   Prepared to work as part of a team, both contributing and suggesting ideas
 -   amongst many other very desirable attributes

These are the types of employees that any company wants to retain. However, the cost of hiring someone to replace them is considerable in terms of time and money. For example, suppose a team member approaches you with a business case to attend a conference. On the other hand, the cost of sending this team member to a conference has a fantastic return on investment; many reasons are given below. In addition, it can be considered a training expense, which can be offset against tax.

Speakers at conferences are typically experts in their chosen fields of expertise. As a result, they are more than happy to answer questions. However, since a conference setting is more informal than a training session, this setting can allow the attendee to speak to the experts and speakers directly.

Some of the topics covered in the conference sessions can be very in-depth technically. Attending these sessions can allow the opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and experience from experts in narrow fields of expertise. To gain access to these skills via consultancy could be considerably more expensive. Examples of skills include SQL query tuning, data culture, data modelling, and DAX, to name a few of the skills. Having team members with knowledge of these skills can be of considerable business benefit.

Finding and recruiting experts in various fields can be expensive and time-consuming. So technical conferences can be used as an opportunity to "Grow your experts" and grow employees into roles; as their expertise and knowledge increase, they can take on more complex technical tasks. These employees gain job satisfaction and, if treated well (such as sending them to conferences), can generate considerable loyalty for the employer. The alternative approaches are to engage a consultant or hire an experienced person with the required skills. Unfortunately, both options can be considerably more expensive than the first, which is to "Grow your experts".

The conferences provide the ideal opportunity for the team member to discuss solutions to issues without requiring them to pay a consultancy for such advice. These conversations can lead directly to a solution or other possible alternative solutions. If a consultancy is required to be engaged, then the team member would be able to speak more confidently about the company's specifications and requirements.

An integral part of the IT industry is the constant development of new technology and innovations. Conferences are the ideal time and place to gain awareness of new technologies and innovations. These are ideal opportunities to gain insight from pioneers in these areas. To learn about the weaknesses and strengths of new technologies and innovations. Within the data community, there is a desire to speak about new technologies and innovations. Awareness of these technologies or innovations. This will allow the opportunity to evaluate if these technologies or innovations are worth considering/bring business benefit. If considering the new technology, the team member should be aware of the technologies' relative advantages and disadvantages. Attending sessions will be an ideal opportunity to hear first-hand, from often a neutral source, the advantages and disadvantages of new technologies or innovations.

The session topics offered at conferences also include such best practices and many reasons why to use the best practices. These sessions inspire changes which can impact very positively on productivity. The insights gained from such sessions can be a significant benefit. The impact of implementing such best practices can have significant positive benefits.

Being part of the community, the team member is aware of other people's skills and abilities and if your company is considering hiring for a new role. For example, team members attending conferences, they can recommend a person speak to someone about a vacant position. If they took up the role, this would save on recruitment fees and make them a better fit for the team. These are also the type of proactive, solution-oriented people who can make a positive contribution to the company.

Suppose the team member is part of a small department. By attending the conference, community involvement means they feel a part of a much larger community. As a result, there is cross-fertilisation and exchange of ideas, which may not occur during day-to-day business. These can often lead to considerable business benefits, greater efficiency, and saving money (licensing costs), amongst many other benefits.

As a result of making contacts and friendships within the technical community, this can have the benefit of access to expert consultants. Whilst the community may need help to resolve the issue directly. They can and do provide guidance, assurance, and suggestions for solutions. Building these personal connections means that the person has a much more comprehensive and extensive support network they can call on to assist when the company has to resolve issues. This is an indirect, intangible asset which should not be underestimated.

The active community member can become the "go-to" person if someone has an issue they need help with (the same person who wants to attend conferences). As they have been to sessions, they heard some speak about the topic. If they are helpful and generous, that is an asset which is only sometimes recognised or rewarded. They can help to resolve or provide help to solutions which people are struggling to resolve. They might know someone they can ask about a specific topic and note that this is an integral part of being part of the community.

As a consultant, part of my role is to advise and guide my clients to find the best solution. I often recommend an approach that a community member has recommended or suggested. Of these people, I have has the privilege and pleasure of meeting at conferences. Sometimes I will mention that I met these community members. My credibility increases in the client's eyes because I know the community member.

Suppose the company pays to send a team member to the conference. Then when the team member returns to the office. Then, if they feel comfortable, they could carry out some short session(s) with their colleagues about what they got from the conference. This could take many forms: informal chats or a more structured session.
