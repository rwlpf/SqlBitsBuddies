## Feedback

**

Has there been any feedback from attendees

**Community zone,**

-   Really worked well
-   big focal point with events
-   Need a better whiteboard solution

-   bigger than what was provided
-   Or several small ones

-   The info board was great but then there was no other board

-   Sound was an issue hearing what was going on in the Community Zone
-   Dining tables make it easier for lone people to join a table/conversation, rather than just standing around
-   Comfortable seating etc encouraged people to sit and talk to others
-   Bits Buddy presents

-   E.g. Becoming a helper

**Meet the teachers**

-   Didn't seem to matter about speaking to the speakers, the attendees were using it as an opportunity to get them together in one place
-   Good atmosphere, but speakers talking to speakers - was it just the 'in crowd'?

-   Attendees found this intimidating so may need to separate locations for different speakers
-   Or different location from where speakers are staying so its separate

-   Did other people from other hotels attend this, or was it just those local to the events (might not know the area)
-   Could just publicise a meeting point/time rather than meet the speaker

-   But if you're nervous going somewhere with a purpose makes it easier to go

-   Good to give something to do on the nights with no social events

**Board Games and helping people meet each other**

-   There were links building up but not sure it solved the lone person on their own
-   Annette was really good at introducing people to Angela who introduced them to others
-   Format - pile of games

-   People weren't sure if you could go and pick a game up
-   Could we have a game on a table and then join if you want to play/watch that game with someone else managing
-   Games list up front might have been useful

**Going out to dinner - DROP**

-   Didn't really work

-   Didn't have a whiteboard to publicise it

-   Logistics are difficult

-   Need to plan ahead, know the venue, know the restaurants
-   Do you book a table, for how many, is there a deposit
-   Pass summit was OK because had same venue each time, but itâ€™s hard when it moves around a lot
-   If venue allows takeout you could do delivery for a group but excel was not accommodating

-   Can't say if they want to take this on again because don't know the venue/area

**Quiz night**

-   Suggest a couple of tables by community corner for people to join with some buddies so they can help set attendees up with other teams
-   Wasn't clear to new attendees that there was food provided
-   Need to change branding to "Quiz and Curry"?

-   Needs better publicity

-   App did have lunch, and dinner

-   Maybe need to publicise use of the app more

**Lunch with the buddies and morning meet**

-   Didn't get many people

-   Should have done Tuesday,

**Buddy Activities**

-   Going up to people to talk to them pushed buddies out of their comfort zone

-   Good to have as a task

-   Didn't have a chance to do it as much because  **not enough helpers**  (Tues/Wed) to cover having lunch, minding the room, handing out bags etc.)

-   Can paid staff look after rooms during breaks/lunch so all helpers can leave the room? Especially if there is only one helper

-   Cheat sheet of ice breakers to help buddies with conversation starters

-   E.g. Have you been to bits before, do you want to be a helper?!

-   On general session days there isn't enough time between sessions to be a buddy/meet people

-   Compounded by not knowing who other helper was in the room

-   Maybe buddies should RM less so they can be in Community Zone more

-   Separate part of app to allow buddies to allocate themselves to Community Zone at specific times

**Briefings**

-   Didn't know who each other were, so can they have a briefing after morning briefing to decide what they want to do and divide responsibilities
-   Need to introduce buddies during briefings (like we do with runners) so everyone knows who they are and so they can bring attendees over to talk to them

**Identification**

-   All orange shirts should be approachable, but being able to identify buddies would help
-   If helpers need to leave a conversation to go do Room Monitoring, they can hand them over to a buddy
-   Did everyone know we even had buddies?

**Next Steps**

-   Define a mission statement

-   So there is direction

-   Establish as a 'brand' so they work more effectively
-   Regular catchups?

-   Not all buddies want to do online during the year, prefer to only do in-event
-   16 buddies(?) but only 5 on call
-   Set up monthly calls (Steph) but Buddies to drive agenda

-   Victoria to send agenda a week before event

-   Activities for the rest of the year

-   Topics for webinar - bits buddies present

-   Coming to SQLBits
-   Conference attendance in general
-   How to persuade your boss to send you to SQLBits
-   Getting the best out of the event

-   There are re-runs of videos maybe have a few bits buddies on the call for the chat
-   Wider channels - other user groups?
-   Robert's videos?

-   What's happening with this - last update was with Annabel
-   Where are they going to be posted?

-   YouTube
-   SQLBits site

-   Could put webinars in same place?

-   Slack

-   Keep using for now, but think about what to do going forward
